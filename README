tingle(8) - (n): a thin temporary patch
=======================================

tingle acts as a thin frontend to your operating system's native package 
manager.  Unlike native tools, the tingle program serves only a single 
purpose:  to keep all installed software packages up to date with 
respect to your repository mirrors.  It does this whilst presenting a 
simple interface, consistent across all recognised operating systems, 
and is usable by human and machine operators alike.

tingle was designed to take aggressive charge over an environment 
scaling many hundreds of heterogeneous systems.  Carefully 
orchestrated autonomous operation is possible with the aid of tools like 
[Func][] or [The Marionette Collective][].  tingle excels in 
environments where the risk and cost of a single compromised system 
exceeds the likelihood and cost of a faulty update (regression).

If precise change management is a staple of your environment, ensure 
your local package repositories contain only those updates you are 
prepared to propagate.  Alternatively, exercise thorough use of your 
native package manager's pinning capabilities.  tingle will gobble down 
whatever you leave in the open.

Site or host-specific maintenance procedures can be condensed into 
tingle hook scripts and executed at precise points in the patch process.  
For instance, a site's configuration management system could distribute 
a tingle hook to have a host temporarily check itself out of the site's 
availability monitoring system before rebooting.
