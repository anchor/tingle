Description: A package updater for busy system administrators
 .
 tingle is a tool for applying packaged software updates.  It works by wrapping 
 a thin shell program around your operating system's native package manager.  
 Pesky differences between package management implementations are abstracted 
 away to simplify patch procedure.
