Description: A package updater for busy system administrators
 .
 tingle acts as a thin frontend to your operating system's native 
 package  manager.  Unlike native tools, the tingle program serves only 
 a single purpose:  to keep all installed software packages up to date 
 with respect to your repository mirrors.  It does this whilst 
 presenting a simple interface, consistent across all recognised 
 operating systems, and is usable by human and machine operators alike.
