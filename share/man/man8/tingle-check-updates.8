.
.SH "NAME"
\fBtingle\-check\-updates\fR \- checks for pending updates
.
.P
Part of the tingle(8) suite\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBtingle\fR \fBcheck\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
check\-updates may be used to determine whether or not a system is up to date\. This determination is always carried out with respect to your repository mirrors (apt or yum sources)\.
.
.P
check\-updates will output a sorted list of pending updates to standard output using the following format (fields are separated with a single space):
.
.P
\fB<PACKAGE NAME>\fR \fB<PENDING VERSION>\fR
.
.P
The following hook scripts, if they exist, will be executed when appropriate:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB/etc/tingle/hooks/pre\-check\.d/*\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB/etc/tingle/hooks/post\-check\.d/*\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Execution order will correspond to the lexical sort order of script file names\. The first hook script failure will trigger an immediate abort\.
.
.P
List packages, one per line, in \fB/etc/tingle/unimportant\-packages\fR to have them ignored by check\-updates\. Each line will be interpreted as a POSIX BRE\. Unimportant packages will not be written to standard output by check\-updates\. The list of unimportant packages is \fInot\fR a list of packages to ignore\. Updates to unimportant packages are ignored so long as the only pending updates to the system are to unimportant packages\.
.
.br
As soon as an update to a \-\- retrospectively named \-\- important package is available, all pending updates (important or otherwise) will be applied\. This mechanism is designed to prevent unwarranted reboots for trivial package updates\.
.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns 0 if the system has no updates pending\.
.P
Returns 100 if the system has at least one update pending\.
.
.P
Returns 1 on error\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Non\-interactive mode may be forced by setting TINGLE_NONINTERACTIVE\.
