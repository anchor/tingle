.
.SH "NAME"
\fBtingle\-reboot\fR \- reboots the system
.
.P
Part of the tingle(8) suite\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBtingle\fR \fBreboot\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Rebooting a system is still the simplest and most reliable means of loading modified kernel and shared object code into memory\. (But see http://www\.ksplice\.com/ for a promising take on the kernel problem\.)
.
.P
While checking for open, updated libraries and selectively restarting affected daemons might sound nifty in theory, the practical complexity behind such an implementation is hardly warranted\. Suck up the reboot\.
.
.br
You should be regularly testing your boot scripts, anyway\.
.
.P
The following hook scripts, if they exist, will be executed when appropriate:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB/etc/tingle/hooks/pre\-reboot\.d/*\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB/etc/tingle/hooks/post\-reboot\.d/*\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Execution order will correspond to the lexical sort order of script file names\. Hook script failures are ignored\.
.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns non\-zero if something broke\. Run interactively for full standard error output\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Non\-interactive mode may be forced by setting TINGLE_NONINTERACTIVE\.
